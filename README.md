## School District Analysis
An analysis of math and reading scores for a school district. Programs used: Python, Anaconda, Pandas, and Jupyter.

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to eliminate the skewed math and reading scores for Thomas High School, due to academic dishonesty.

# Results
Due to speculation of academic dishonsty for the ninth grade students at Thomas High School their math and reading scores were replaced with NaN.  The purpose of this was to get a better reflection of the overall passing percentages for the school and for the district.  With the new information we are able to see that the overall percentages fell.  This then affected the schools budget. 

# Summary
While this data is helpful in determining a better picture of the school budget, it does not determine how many students were dishonest or if it was the school itself that skewed the data.
